    <br>A simple calculator built using python's tkinter module.
</p>

## Motivation

This is the first GUI project I worked on. I built it to learn and understand tkinter's various features and functionalities. 

## Usage

**Prerequisite** : Python 3 and PIL

Before launching the application, make sure you have PIL installed. To do so, just launch your terminal and type `pip install Pillow`

Run the `Simple-Calculator.py` file present in the `src` folder.

Or, launch your terminal and `cd/` to the src folder and type `python Simple-Calculator.py`.
